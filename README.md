# Spooky Author Identification
## Overview:
Can you predict the author of a given horror story excerpt? This project explores the works of three iconic authors: Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and H.P. Lovecraft. Harnessing the power of natural language processing techniques, I aim to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately attributing a given text to one of these authors based on distinctive writing styles and themes present in their stories. 

## Data: 
The data for this project comes from a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification/overview). Some key points: 
- There are nearly 20,000 excerpts from horror stories written by either Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, or H.P. Lovecraft.
- There is a training file and a separate testing file. Both contain a unique ID for each line, the line itself, and only the train file contains the author.
